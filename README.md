Bunch of Helpful Scripts for daily use whether in normal usage or CTFs. Will add as I make some.


	ProcKill.sh - Enter a process name within the shellscript to display its PID and KILL.

	BrightnessAdjust.sh - To vary the Screen Brightness on Intel based systems with internal Graphics. (eg. Intel HD)
	(This additional feature requires "redshift" installed) Also as a bonus I've included a night light enabling functionality.

	BinHexOct__To__ASCII.sh - To convert Binary, Hexadeximal or Octal numbers to its corresponding ASCII form. eg -> Hexadecimal 0x65 converts to ASCII "a"
