This is a script to adjust the brightness on an Arch Linux based system, and also has an option to use the Night-light feature
enabled by 'redshift' cli. 


The brightness adjust method only works for intel based laptops, since I personally use a thinkpad with integrated intel HD 4000 graphics.


This script can be modified to be used with any other systems, for universal compatibility which will be added in the future and is
my initial attempt at bash scripting.
